  abstract={Science represents a significant human achievement, and has been a force for technological and societal change. It is also a complex social enterprise with many interacting stakeholders, which has given rise to a complex academic ecosystem. Within this ecosystem, scientists, universities, funding bodies, publishers, governments and many more interact to support its advancement. It is necessary to look at science through the scientific lens to help these stakeholders understand, shape and guide the development of this system. The present Topical Issue looks precisely at this meta-science, more commonly known as the science of science}
